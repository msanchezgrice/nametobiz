# üö® URGENT: Vercel Deployment Fix Required

## The Problem
Your Vercel project has a conflicting `rootDirectory` setting that's preventing proper deployment. The setting is hardcoded in Vercel's web dashboard and cannot be changed via CLI.

### Current Issue:
- Vercel Project Settings has: `rootDirectory: "apps/web"`
- This causes path doubling: `apps/web/apps/web`
- Result: Build shows 0ms and nothing deploys

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### 1. Go to Vercel Project Settings
Visit: https://vercel.com/miguel-sanchezgrices-projects/nametobiz/settings

### 2. Find the General Settings
Look for the "Root Directory" field in the General section

### 3. Clear the Root Directory
- Remove `apps/web` from the Root Directory field
- Leave it completely empty/blank
- This will make Vercel use the repository root

### 4. Update Build & Output Settings
While you're there, ensure these settings are:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (or Auto-detect)
- **Build Command**: `cd apps/web && npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `apps/web/.next`
- **Install Command**: `cd apps/web && npm install`

### 5. Save Changes
Click the Save button

### 6. Trigger Redeployment
Either:
- Click "Redeploy" in Vercel dashboard
- Or push any small change to GitHub to trigger auto-deployment

## üéØ Expected Result
After these changes, your deployment should:
- Actually run the build (taking 30-60 seconds, not 0ms)
- Successfully deploy your Next.js app
- Make your site accessible at https://nametobiz.com

## üìù Note
All the code fixes have been completed. The only remaining issue is this Vercel project configuration that needs to be changed in the web dashboard.
